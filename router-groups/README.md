# Next.js Route Groups ( )

Purpose: Organize folders without changing the URL.organize files, doesnâ€™t appear in URL.
Syntax: Wrap folder name in parentheses (groupName).
Effect: Folder does not appear in URL, only used for file structure.

 - userfolder a folder name is in parentheses ( ) inside app/ â†’ itâ€™s a route group.
   
## Example:
app/
 â”œâ”€ (auth)/login/page.js     â†’ URL: /login
 â”œâ”€ (auth)/register/page.js  â†’ URL: /register

Use case: Group related pages (like auth, dashboard) neatly.
Key point: Route groups = folder organization only, URL stays clean.


# `<label>` in HTML/React  
## What is it?  
- `<label>` is used to give a name/title to a form input (like textbox, checkbox, etc.).  

## Key Points  
- Connects to input using `for` (HTML) or `htmlFor` (React).  
- Must match inputâ€™s `id`.  
- Clicking the label auto-focuses or toggles the input.  
- Helps **accessibility** (screen readers).  

## Example  
<label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
<input id="email" type="email" />

## dot
placeholder="â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢"
 use option+8 u will get this dots.

## the apostrophe (') part.

In JSX, you can write it in two ways:
Using HTML entity:
Don&apos;t have an account?
â†’ shows as Don't have an account?

Or just directly:
Don't have an account?
âœ… This works fine too.

ðŸ‘‰ &apos; is only needed if you want to be extra safe in HTML.

## <a> vs <Link>
<a> â†’ reloads whole app.Use <a> only for external URLs.
<Link> â†’ faster, smooth navigation (no reload).Does client-side navigation â†’ no full reload, much faster.Good for internal links (pages inside your Next.js app).

## space In JSX, normal spaces can get ignored.
{" "} = manual space between elements or text.

âœ… Correct way:
<Link href="/register" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">
  Register
</Link>

## why use "use client"?
"use client"; = tells Next.js this component runs on the client (browser).
Needed for state, events, hooks (useState, useEffect).
Place it at the top of the file before imports.
## example
If component uses hooks (useState, useEffect) or browser APIs â†’ must be client.
If component just renders static content or fetches data on server â†’ can stay server.
## Note
Without it â†’ component defaults to server component.
By default, everything in app/ folder is a server component.
If you add "use client"; at the top â†’ it becomes a client component.
So: default = server, with "use client" = client.
