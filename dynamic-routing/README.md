## Dynamic Routing in Next.js

# What it is: Routes that change based on data or parameters.
  Syntax: Use [param] in folder/file name.

 Example:

    app/
    â”œâ”€ blog/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ [id]/page.js   â†’ /blog/1, /blog/2

Here [id] is dynamic, can be any value in URL.

## Notes on Dynamic Route Component (User) in Next.js

1. params
    What: Object automatically passed to a page component by Next.js.
    Why: Contains URL parameters for dynamic routes.
    Example meaning: If route is /user/nirmal, then params.user = "nirmal".

2. {params} in function signature
    What: Destructuring of the props object passed to the component.
    Why: Makes it easier to access params directly instead of props.params.

3. Type annotation {params: {user: string}}
    What: TypeScript way to define what params contains.
    Why: Helps type-checking; ensures params.user is always a string.

4. async keywor
    What: Marks a function as asynchronous
    Why: Only needed if you plan to use await for asynchronous operations, e.g., fetching data
    Important: If you are just reading params, async is unnecessary.

5. await param
    What it does: Waits for a Promise to resolve
    Why itâ€™s wrong here: params is a normal object, not a Promise. Using await on it will break the code.

6. const {user} = params
    What: Destructuring assignment to get the user value from params.
    Why: Cleaner and easier than writing params.user every time.
    Meaning: user now contains the dynamic part of the URL.

7. Dynamic routing concept
    [user] in folder/file name = dynamic segment in URL.
    Allows a single file to handle many URLs like /user/nirmal, /user/john, etc.

8. Rendering user in JSX
    What: Shows the dynamic value on the page.
    Why: Makes page content personalized based on the URL.

9. Rules / Best Practices
    Only use async if fetching data.
    Donâ€™t await normal objects like params.
    Always destructure params for clarity.
    Use TypeScript types for safe coding.

## ðŸ“˜ Next.js params & Dynamic Routing â€” Notes

1. What is params?
    params = object given by Next.js for dynamic routes.
    Contains values from the URL.
    Example: visiting /user/nirmal â†’ params = { user: "nirmal" }.
    ðŸ‘‰ params is not a JS keyword, itâ€™s a Next.js built-in prop.

2. Folder Structure Rules
    Static route: folder name = URL path.
    app/about/page.tsx â†’ /about
    Dynamic route: folder with [ ].
    app/user/[id]/page.tsx â†’ /user/123 or /user/abc
    Nested route: nested folders = deeper URL.
    app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx â†’ /dashboard/settings
    Grouped folder: ( ) for organizing only, hidden in URL.
    app/(auth)/login/page.tsx â†’ /login
    ðŸ‘‰ page.tsx never appears in URL (only renders UI).

3. Using params

    Inside a page component:

    const User = async ({ params }: { params: { user: string } }) => {
    const { user } = params;  // get "user" from URL
    return <h1>Hello {user}</h1>;
    };


    Breakdown
    ({ params }) â†’ destructuring props
    : { params: { user: string } } â†’ TypeScript typing
    const { user } = params; â†’ get value from params.

4. Process Step by Step

    Create folder with [ ] â†’ makes route dynamic
    Example: app/user/[user]/page.ts
    Visit /user/nirmal â†’ Next.js sends â†’ params = { user: "nirmal" 
    Inside page.tsx, destructure params
    Use value in your component.

âœ… Summary:

    () = hides folder name
    [] = dynamic route
    page.tsx = actual page (not shown in URL)
    params = Next.js object with URL values.
